Hi, I'm Jai! I am a civil and environmental engineer by education, specializing in "water resources engineering". I completed my undergraduate degree from Gandhi Institute of Technology in the beautiful coastal city of [Visakhapatnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visakhapatnam), India, where I studied the usual mix of civil engineering subjects (math, structural engineering, transportation engineering, environmental engineering etc.). While in college, I was the city lead of a national non-profit organization ["Make a Difference"](http://makeadiff.in/) where I managed a group of around 50 volunteers who taught English and communication/career-development skills to children in shelter homes. I was also involved in a variety of other extra-curricular activities while in college, but somehow still managed to graduate with honors (not sure how!).

I moved to the US in 2013, for a Master's program at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah, joining researchers at the [Urban Water Group](http://urbanwater.utah.edu/home). At the group, I worked on a NASA-funded project to advance the understanding of urban impacts on precipitation processes and the water budget in mountain watersheds. As part of my work, I built machine learning models to study urban air quality effects on precipitation, snowpack, streamflow, and water system vulnerability.

After graduation with a M.S. in 2015 I started working for a specialized environmental consulting firm in Los Angeles, CA. My work mainly involves building 1-dimensional and multi-dimensional hydraulic and hydrodynamic surface water models, water quality data management and analysis, and geospatial analysis and GIS. But I also get to do fun stuff like developing new modeling software in Python and building machine learning models.
