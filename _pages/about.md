About me
======
Hi, I'm **Jai**! I am a civil and environmental engineer by education, specializing in water resources engineering. I completed my undergraduate degree from Gandhi Institute of Technology in the beautiful coastal city of [Visakhapatnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visakhapatnam), India, where I studied the usual mix of civil engineering subjects (math, structural engineering, transportation engineering, environmental engineering etc.). While in college, I was the city lead of a national non-profit organization ["Make a Difference"](http://makeadiff.in/) where I managed a group of around 50 volunteers who taught English and communication/career-development skills to children in shelter homes. 

I moved to the US in 2013, for a Master's program at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah, joining researchers at the [Urban Water Group](http://urbanwater.utah.edu/home). At the group, I worked on a NASA-funded project to advance the understanding of urban impacts on precipitation processes and the water budget in mountain watersheds. As part of my [work](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PhDT.......187P), I built machine learning models to study urban air quality effects on precipitation, snowpack, streamflow, and water system vulnerability.

Since graduating with a M.S. in 2015 I have worked for a specialized environmental consulting firm in Los Angeles, CA. My work mainly involves building hydraulic and hydrodynamic surface water models, dam breach and erosion modeling, water quality data management and analysis, and geospatial analysis and GIS. But I also get to do fun stuff like developing new water resources modeling software in Python and building machine learning models.

Interests
======
I'm excited by the applications of **computational modeling** in solving scientific and engineering problems, mainly in the areas of **earth and atmosheric sciences**, **transportation engineering**, **remote sensing** and **engineering risk & reliabilty**. I'm particularly interested in **machine learning** as applied to those areas. Because of my background in water resources engineering, I'm also interested in **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)**. I code primarily in **Python**, but have also worked with R, Matlab, C and C++ in the past.
